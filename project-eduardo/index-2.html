    <p><b>I started this painting because I was inspired by Salvador Dali. Not just by him but by all the painters I was beginning to see as I learned what it meant to be an artist and painter. I had no idea how much work actually went into being a painter, until I started to become one. This is about my tenth painting but I felt it was the one I learned the most from. I learned about blending, as far and dark areas go, the reason for a second coat, and understanding a little bit about my art. I will always adore Dali's work and one day I want to surpass him.</b>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px"> <b> Burning Giraffe</b></h3>
<p><b>I love the way he shapes the body, over insinuates the hip of the person. They almost seem dream-like, as if they are blowing in the wind. This huge person standing in front seemingly taller than the giraffe, creating the dream, it's amazing. Not my favorite, which is why I chose to learn from it. I want to keep the dream alive in some of the works, I don't want to know how the magician does what he does just enjoys what he does.</b>
